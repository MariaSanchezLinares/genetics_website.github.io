**Genomics** is the study of all of a person's genes (the genome), including interactions of those genes with each other and with the person's environment. - National Insitute of Health (NHI)

Before we jump into the world of statistical genetics, here is a brief brief introduction to geneticsâ€”what DNA is, how it works, and why it matters.

## What is DNA?

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the chemical compound that contains the instructions needed to develop and direct the activities of nearly all living organisms. *DNA molecules are made of two twisting, paired strands, often referred to as a double helix.* Each DNA strand is *made of four chemical units, called nucleotide bases*, which comprise the genetic "alphabet." The bases are *adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C)*. Bases on opposite strands pair specifically: an A always pairs with a T; a C always pairs with a G. The order of the As, Ts, Cs, and Gs determines the meaning of the information encoded in that part of the DNA molecule.

## What is a genome?

<p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">

A genome is an organism's complete set of DNA. Virtually every single cell in the body contains a complete copy of the approximately 3 billion DNA base pairs that make up the human genome.

</p>

<p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">

DNA contains the information needed to build the entire human body. A gene traditionally refers to the unit of DNA that carries the instructions for making a specific protein or set of proteins.

</p>

<p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">

Located on 23 pairs of chromosomes packed into the nucleus of a human cell, genes direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. Specifically, an enzyme copies the information in a gene's DNA into a molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The mRNA travels out of the nucleus and into the cell's cytoplasm, where the mRNA is read by a tiny molecular machine called a ribosome, and the information is used to link together small molecules called amino acids in the right order to form a specific protein.

<p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">

Proteins make up body structures like organs and tissue, as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. If a cell's DNA is mutated, an abnormal protein may be produced, which can disrupt the body's usual processes and lead to a disease such as cancer.

</p>

## What is DNA sequencing?

<p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">

Researchers can use DNA sequencing to search for genetic variations and/or mutations that may play a role in the development or progression of a disease. The disease-causing change may be as small as the substitution, deletion, or addition of a single base pair or as large as a deletion of thousands of bases.

</p>

<p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">

Sequencing determines the exact order of bases in DNA. Since A always pairs with a T; a C always pairs with a G; only one strand needs to be reported.

</p>

<p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">

Sequencing by synthesis is the most common method. It uses DNA polymerase (the enzyme in cells that synthesizes DNA) to generate a new strand of DNA from a strand of interest. Tagged nucleotides emit fluorescent signals when added, allowing detection of their sequence. This method produces billions of short reads (about 125 bases each).

</p>

<p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">

To assemble the sequence of all the bases in a large piece of DNA such as a gene, researchers need to read the sequence of overlapping segments. This allows the longer sequence to be assembled from shorter pieces. Each base is read multiple times to ensure accuracy.

</p>

## Why is it important?

<p style="flex: 1; text-align: justify;">

The study of genomics is essential for advancing healthcare. Since genetics interacts with factors like diet and lifestyle, understanding it provides deeper insights into disease mechanisms. It has expanded our understanding of complex diseases like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, leading to improved diagnostics and treatment strategies. Genomics is also used in agriculture, forensic science, ancestry testing, etc.
