This website was created by Maria Sanchez Linares and presents a summary of what I have learned in my Statistical Genetics course!

Here I will walk you through an introduction to genetics background, how to conduct a genome-wide association study in R, multiple testing, genetic ancestry and some of the ethics behind statistical genetics. 

I recommend following along in the order the tabs are presented in the navigation bar.
