Virtually every single cell in the body contains a complete copy of the approximately 3 billion DNA base pairs that make up the human genome.\n\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"flex: 1; text-align: justify;\">\n\nDNA contains the information needed to build the entire human body. A gene traditionally refers to the unit of DNA that carries the instructions for making a specific protein or set of proteins.\n\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"flex: 1; text-align: justify;\">\n\nLocated on 23 pairs of chromosomes packed into the nucleus of a human cell, genes direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. Specifically, an enzyme copies the information in a gene's DNA into a molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The mRNA travels out of the nucleus and into the cell's cytoplasm, where the mRNA is read by a tiny molecular machine called a ribosome, and the information is used to link together small molecules called amino acids in the right order to form a specific protein.\n\n</p>\n\n![](Guide_Genomics_Fact-sheet2020.jpg){width=\"800px\" style=\"border-radius: 20px;\"}\n\n<p style=\"flex: 1; text-align: justify;\">\n\nProteins make up body structures like organs and tissue, as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. If a cell's DNA is mutated, an abnormal protein may be produced, which can disrupt the body's usual processes and lead to a disease such as cancer.\n\n</p>\n\n## What is DNA sequencing?\n\n<p style=\"flex: 1; text-align: justify;\">\n\nResearchers can use DNA sequencing to search for genetic variations and/or mutations that may play a role in the development or progression of a disease. The disease-causing change may be as small as the substitution, deletion, or addition of a single base pair or as large as a deletion of thousands of bases.\n\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"flex: 1; text-align: justify;\">\n\nSequencing determines the exact order of bases in DNA. Since A always pairs with a T; a C always pairs with a G; only one strand needs to be reported.\n\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"flex: 1; text-align: justify;\">\n\nSequencing by synthesis is the most common method. It uses DNA polymerase (the enzyme in cells that synthesizes DNA) to generate a new strand of DNA from a strand of interest. Tagged nucleotides emit fluorescent signals when added, allowing detection of their sequence. This method produces billions of short reads (about 125 bases each).\n\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"flex: 1; text-align: justify;\">\n\nTo assemble the sequence of all the bases in a large piece of DNA such as a gene, researchers need to read the sequence of overlapping segments. This allows the longer sequence to be assembled from shorter pieces. Each base is read multiple times to ensure accuracy.\n\n</p>\n\n## Why is it important?\n\n<p style=\"flex: 1; text-align: justify;\">\n\nThe study of genomics is essential for advancing healthcare. Since genetics interacts with factors like diet and lifestyle, understanding it provides deeper insights into disease mechanisms. It has expanded our understanding of complex diseases like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, leading to improved diagnostics and treatment strategies. Genomics is also used in agriculture, forensic science, ancestry testing, etc.\n\n</p>\n\n## References\n\n<p style=\"flex: 1; text-align: justify;\">\n\nNational Human Genome Research Institute.
